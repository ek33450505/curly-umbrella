                <h5>I am a recent graduate of the Ohio State University full-stack web development program. After working as a management professional for over 10 years, I decided that it was time for a career change. I love learning new technologies and developing applications that enhance the user experience. I currently live in Columbus, Ohio with my wife and two children. My other interests include trail running and training for Ultra Marathons.</h5>
